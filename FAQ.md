# iplookup FAQ

### **Q: Which Internet Protocol (IP) Versions are accepted?**
#### A: Both IPv4 and IPv6 standards are supported

### **Q: Which input formats can be used?**
#### A: IPv4 needs to be formatted exactly as such: A.B.C.D, where A, B, C, and D are integers between 0 and (up to and including) 255. Preceding zeros in each of these numbers have to be truncated.IPv6 can also be formatted in their usual manner. They can be shortened/collapsed as well, e.g. multiple consecutive 16 - bit blocks with a values of 0, 0000 respectively can be shortened to two colons. An example of a correctly formatted IPv6 Adress is the following: fe80::b026:a898:9bbf:8bfc
